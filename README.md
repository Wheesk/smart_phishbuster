# Smart PhishBuster 

A real-time phishing detection system combining a browser extension and a Python machine learning backend. Detects phishing attempts by analyzing suspicious URLs, webpage content, and user behavior—using an ML model trained on thousands of real-world examples.

Note:
While Smart PhishBuster uses advanced techniques to detect phishing attempts in real time, it does not guarantee 100% accuracy. Like all security tools, it may occasionally produce false positives or miss certain threats.
Use at your own risk, and always double-check before entering sensitive information.

# What does it do?
Analyzes URLs and webpage features, predicts ‘legit’ or ‘phishing’,and displays a warning in the browser.

It looks at the URL and the page behind it and pulls out 30 simple yes/no signals:

“Does the address use an IP number instead of a name?”

“Is it really long?”

“Does it have weird JavaScript tricks?”

“Is it on a shortener like bit.ly?”

…and so on, up to “Is it known as malware by Google Safe Browsing?”

Each signal becomes a +1 (yes) or –1 (no).

##  Features

- 30+ feature extraction from URLs, domain info, and page content
- Random Forest classifier (95% accuracy, balanced precision/recall)
- Flask API for fast /predict endpoint
- Chrome Extension for real-time site checks
- Whitelisting of trusted domains and popularity-based overrides
- Parallel, cached feature extraction for fast response times
- Full test suite and easy retraining pipeline

##  Installation

Clone the repo and set up a virtual environment:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Wheesk/smart_phishbuster.git
cd smart-phishbuster
python -m venv .venv

# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Threshold Tuning
Model performance can be tuned by selecting a different decision threshold. Here are precision/recall values at various thresholds:
```bash
Threshold	Precision	Recall
0.00	    0.50	    1.00
0.01    	0.67     	1.00
0.02	    0.69    	0.99
0.04	    0.75	    0.99
0.07    	0.90	    0.98
0.11	    0.92    	0.98
0.14	    0.94    	0.98
0.32	    0.97    	0.97
0.68	    0.99    	0.94
0.87	    0.99    	0.93
0.90	    0.99    	0.89
0.93	    1.00    	0.86
0.98	    1.00    	0.81
1.00	    1.00    	0.76

Very low threshold (e.g. 0.00–0.06) Recall=100% →  catches every phishing URL.
Precision low (50–70%) → but half (or more) of “phishing” alerts are false alarms.

Mid-range threshold (e.g. 0.19)Recall ≈ 96% → catches almost every phish.
Precision ≈ 94% → and over nine out of ten of alerts are real phishing.

High threshold (e.g. 0.85–0.99)
Precision=100% → when you say “phishing,” you’re never wrong.
Recall drops to 83–57% → misses a lot of real phishing sites.

In summary:
By lowering the threshold, I catch more phishing sites but also create more false alarms; 
by raising it, I eliminate false alarms at the cost of missing more phishing sites; 
a middle-ground threshold (around 0.19) catches most phishing while keeping false alarms very low.
```
##  Example Model Training Output
```
 Shape   : (1992, 31)
 Legit   : 995
 Phish   : 997
 Missing : False
 Trained — Classes: [-1  1]
 Accuracy : 0.9449
 Report   :
               precision    recall  f1-score   support

          -1       0.95      0.94      0.95       216
           1       0.94      0.95      0.94       183

    accuracy                           0.94       399

Those 30 numbers get “scaled” so our model treats them fairly.

A Random Forest classifier (think: a committee of decision-trees) looks at the pattern of +1/–1 and returns a probability that the site is phishing.

##  Limitations & Future Work
Most phishing URLs are dead (normal in research)

Occasional false positives on very long legit URLs (can be handled with more training data and whitelisting)

Can integrate real-time feeds (PhishTank/OpenPhish) for even fresher data

Deployment on cloud (Render/Heroku) and Chrome Web Store possible
